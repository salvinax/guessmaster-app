# guessmaster-app
A small quiz app built using Java on Android Studio. Player attempts to guess a celebrity's birthday (using MM/DD/YYYY format). The player receives "tickets" if birthdate is guessed correctly or is prompted to try again if they input the wrong date. App was created for an object oriented programming class (ELEC 279). This project helped me learn and understand fundemental OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
